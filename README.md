# Screamer

Screamer is a twitter clone. 

## Purpose

Attempt to exemplify an all-in-one docker compose setup. It features a departure from the standard Entity Framework Migrations system, and instead uses Liquibase for handling database changes.

The application uses docker compose to start a Database (Postgresql), a Database client (PG Admin), a backend and API (.NET), and a Front End (???)
